## Original entry notes

```
Description
-----------
As commander of the Swarm of Colored Sprites you must enlargen your population by engaging
in combat with hostile swarms and conquer their members to the side of pure green.

Over time the members of your mutant army will bow under to the massive pressure it is being a sprite, and 
thus deteriorate into thin air. So keep engaging and conquering enemies, or you will get weaker and weaker.

Hostile swarms will engage in combat with other swarms, including yours, at times of extreme bravery.
And sometimes they'll just flee.

Instructions
------------
Drag your swarm of blobby-looking sprites using the mouse to avoid or conquer enemy swarms.

Controls
--------
Mouse	- Hold down any mouse button and drag around your swarm
